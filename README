django-classroom quiz is an application I built for my Senior Thesis in education at Utah State University. The code as it stands now is a mess, and is still deeply embedded with the orginal django project(which contains code I do not want to release to the wild) 

This version is available under the terms of the MIT licence. Please note though that my long term intent will likely be to re-licence this and move this to a copyleft licence in general, but with some more permissive terms that are favorable to schools, over companies selling hosting/services to schools.

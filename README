django-classroom quiz is an application I built for my Senior Thesis in education at Utah State University. The code as it stands now is a mess, and is still deeply embedded with the orginal django project(which contains code I do not want to release to the wild) 

installation
============
The basic application should install like any other django app:
* copy the 'django-classroomquiz/' directory into the project folder
* add "django-classroomquiz" to installed apps in settings.py
* add a line to urls.py to make the app visible.
  - something like "(R'^quiz/', include('django-classroomquiz.urls')" should behave sanely).
Usage
=====
Any user can create a quiz by going to "yoursite.com/quiz/add/" Web form should be fairly straitforward, enter a question, a number of possible multiple choice answers and check which answer, or answers you are willing to accept as correct. 

Roadmap
=======
-Incorporate Classes, Students and Instructors with seperate privledges
-Improve front end interface for quiz addding and editing
-Add the Item Distractor Analysis to stats
-Provide a more interactive and meaningful statistics analysis
-Additional Item Types(short response etc)
-Teacher Grading Override(this is basically nessicary if we want to include any kind of free response question, because a small match problem would equal missed points for a student)
